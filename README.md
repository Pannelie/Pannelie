- 👋 Hi, I’m Annelie
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about JavaScript on my journey to become a frontend developer. 
- 💞️ I’m more than happy to learn more about tips and tricks around the web if you have any tricks up your sleeve. For now Im not so far in to be able to inspire others, but hope one day I will!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started out as a kindergarden teacher, and have now put that career at pause to make my way towards becomings a frontend developer.
